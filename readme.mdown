# minlo - a library mobile site template

A mobile template that other libraries can feel free to run with. Based on a template written by Jason Clark of Montana Stata University which is available here: https://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/files.php

Utilizes [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) and [the Google Maps Static API](https://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/).

I'd strongly recommend reading over [the jQuery Mobile documentation](http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/) if you want to make extensive edits to this template. It's not too hard to figure out but it doesn't work like a regular website (uses AJAX to load pieces of a single HTML file instead of a multi-page site) so the code may look confusing at first.

See [the customization doc](customization.mdown) for information on adapting the template to your specific needs.
