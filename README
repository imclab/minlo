README
A mobile template that other libraries can feel free to run with. Licensed under GPLv3 (https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Based on a template written by Jason Clark of Montana Stata University available here: https://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/files.php

Utilizes jQuery Mobile (http://jquerymobile.com/) and the Google Maps Static API (https://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/).

I'd strongly recommend reading over the jQuery Mobile documentation if you want to make extensive edits to this template. It's not too hard to figure out but it doesn't work like a regular website (uses AJAX to load pieces of a single HTML file instead of a multi-page site) so the code may look confusing at first.

CUSTOMIZATION
To make this site useful for your library, remove the Chesapeake College LRC content and replace it with your own. These sections are all CCLRC-specific:
a) Remove the analytics comment in the head tag and insert your own analytics code.
b) Review the Ask a Librarian code and change the phone number, email address, and chat link.
c) Change the "full site" link at the bottom of each page to your full site. A simple search & replace in the HTML should do it.
d) Change the longitude  latitude of the Google Maps API center position to something more suitable for your institution.
e) Change the catalog search to work with your catalog. If you have a mobile-friendly catalog, this would be a good place to tie into it.
f) Replace our LibGuides site with your study guide equivalent. If you do have LibGuides, make sure to leave "mobile.php" on the end of the URL so users get the mobile-optimized version.
g) Change the hours to match your open hours.

The Mobile Research Resources page might be the only one you don't need to tweak, but you may need to change the Academic Search Premier link to work with your proxy server.
