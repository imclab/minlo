CUSTOMIZATION
To make this site useful for your library, you'll obviously need to remove the Chesapeake College LRC content and replace it with your own. I've tried to provide a list here of all the content to specific to us.

-> Remove the analytics comment in the head tag and insert your own analytics code.
-> Review the Ask a Librarian code and change the phone number, email address, and chat link. Insert your own Library H3lp, Meebo, or other chat widget on the chat page.
-> Change the "full site" link at the bottom of each page to your full site. A simple search & replace should do it.
-> Change the longitude  latitude of the Google Maps API center position to something more suitable for your institution. Move the blue marker as well.
-> Change the catalog search to work with your catalog. If you have a mobile-friendly catalog, this would be a good place to tie into it.
-> Replace our LibGuides site with your study guide equivalent. If you do have LibGuides, make sure to leave "mobile.php" on the end of the URL so users get the mobile version.
-> Change the hours to match your open hours.
-> Change the color scheme to one that suits your institution. You can choose from a set of 5 themes (a through e) using the data-theme attribute. You can develop a custom theme with the jQuery Themeroller: http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/ - I would recommend doing so unless you're really in a rush. Building a single theme saves you a lot of bytes in your CSS file, since going with the default includes all the themes you don't use as well.

The Mobile Research Resources page might be the only one you don't need to tweak, but you may need to change the Academic Search Premier link to work with your proxy server.
